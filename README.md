# My Portifolio
Website to promote and display my projects

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
* [React Popup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-popupbox)
* [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## How I build it
Creating interesting UI's is always a challenge. However, with Bootstrap, that wansn't such a big deal. The biggest challenge of this project was, without a doubt, the form to send me an email. I've never done anything like it before, so I had to study it online. I've found React Hook Form that solves the form validation and EmailJS to actually send the form information as an email. To deploy my portifolio I used Firebase.
